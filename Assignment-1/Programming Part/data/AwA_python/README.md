Instruction for running the code:
1. Download the files convex.py and regress.py in the same directory which contains all the .npy files.
   (Data files must be placed in the same directory as the code).
   If this is not adhered to, you can also change the path in the code to the path where the data files are placed, in the 
   part of the code named "Loading the dataset."
2. Finally, run the code by getting into the directory where these files have been placed, and using commands:
   python convex.py
   python regress.py
3. On running the code, a detailed output shall be displayed on the standard output device, which shall also provide the 
   classification accuracy. For more details on how the code actually works behind the scenes, read all the comments.

Please write to me on omsingh21@iitk.ac.in if the code doesn't run properly, and I will troubleshoot the issue.
The code is working on my device as intended.
